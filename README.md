This repository contains an application that studies Systems of Linear Equations involving unimodular matrices. The application's graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using JavaFX SDK, while the main logic of the application is implemented in a Python script. Additionally, the results of the computations are presented in a clear and visible manner using the LaTeX typesetting system, generating a PDF file.

## Introduction

In mathematics, a system of linear equations, or a linear system, consists of a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. This paper aims to explore Systems of Linear Equations with unimodular matrices, which are square matrices whose determinant is either |1| or |-1|. 

To implement the logic required for solving such systems, we have chosen to utilize Python due to its extensive range of libraries and feasibility. Specifically, we will leverage the power of the NumPy library for creating and performing operations on matrices.

## Features

- GUI development using JavaFX SDK for a user-friendly interface.
- Python script for implementing the main logic to solve Systems of Linear Equations with unimodular matrices.
- Utilization of the NumPy library for matrix creation and operations.
- LaTeX typesetting system for generating clear and visible results.
- Conversion of the results to a PDF file for easy access and sharing.

## Requirements

To run the application, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) with JavaFX SDK.
- Python interpreter (Python 3.8 recommended).
- NumPy library for Python.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Set up the JavaFX environment and compile the Java code for the GUI.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary Python dependencies installed, including NumPy.

4. Run the Python script to execute the main logic of the application.

5. The application will generate a PDF file containing the visible and clear results of the Systems of Linear Equations involving unimodular matrices.
